WEEK #1; 
    Having prior experience with unity made starting the first assignment easier, but I also appriciate how easy and straight forword the youtube video is. Following it so far has made the develpment process easy and serves as a safety net thats I can always refer back to. I would say I am about half way finished with the game, coding the pipes was a struggle but I eventually managed to complete and was able to run smoothly. Using github is something new to me, I've seen and heard of it but never really used it so figuring out the features it has was new but fun. Reading the textbook assigned is definitely different than typical textbooks you receive from other classes, I find myself enoying it. I never really thought in depth how much effort and factors it takes to create a game. The information in the textbook will certainly help me with the development of my final game which I have been thinking about like what theme it will be, whats packs I can use but nothing confirmed.
